* Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is evaluating given boolean equation for its satisfiability. A SAT solver will return any satisfying instance of variables if the equation is satisfiable otherwise will return ‘UNSAT’, short for equation is unsatisfiable.
* Solved satisfiability problem where inputs given in DIMACS CNF format. Program accepts boolean expressions with any number of variable and any number of clause in DIMACS CNF format from “input.cnf” file. Results are printed into “output.cnf”.
