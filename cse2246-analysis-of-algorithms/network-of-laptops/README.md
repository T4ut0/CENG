*  Given a set of n agents with their positions and wireless ranges, designed an algorithm based on Breadth-first Search (BFS) to compute the hop-distance from the first laptop to every other reachable laptop(s). If agent i is not reachable from agent j then the hop distance h(i, j) will be set to 0.
