# Analysis_Of_Algorithms
* In this experiment, we have compared six methods for finding the median in various input lists (of various sizes and various characteristics). We have decided on sample inputs to best clarify the performance characteristics of algorithms. While doing our emprical analysis, we've counted actual number of basic operation's executions.
