# Digital_Logic_Design
* In this project, we have designed a CPU which supports subset of instructions from architecture known as LC-3 (Little Computer 3). The LC-3 specifies a word size of 16 bits for its registers and uses a 16-bit addressable memory with a 216-location address space. The register file contains sixteen registers, referred to by number as R0 through R15. All of the registers are generalpurpose in that they may be freely used by any of the instructions that can write to the register file.
